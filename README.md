# react-ts-webpack-bare
A bare bones React, TypeScript &amp; Webpack project base, created as a lightweight alternative to CRA (`create-react-app`). It may be used as a foundation to build or test simple React and Typescript applications that use Webpack as the bundler. Unlike CRA, this project is minimalistic and doesn't come with the extra configurations that support hot reloading, unit testing, etc. It is good for learners who only need to focus on React, TypeScript and Webpack
